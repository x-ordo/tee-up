# TEE:UP Design System Principles

## Overview
The TEE:UP design system is built upon a philosophy of "Korean Luxury Minimalism," emphasizing "Calm Control." This approach aims to create a sophisticated, intuitive, and visually harmonious experience for both VIP Golfers and Professional Golfers. Our design choices are heavily influenced by the Apple Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) to ensure a premium, user-centric, and accessible product.

## Core Principles

### 1. Visual-First Storytelling
**Goal**: To communicate information primarily through compelling visuals (imagery, video, data visualization) rather than dense text.
*   **HIG Alignment**: Prioritizes visual hierarchy and engaging content presentation, similar to Apple's focus on rich media and intuitive visual layouts.
*   **Magazine-Style**: Content layouts mimic high-end golf magazines, using generous white space, impactful photography, and strategic typography to draw the eye and convey information efficiently.
*   **Data-Backed Trust**: Performance statistics, certifications, and reviews are presented through clear, scannable data visualizations and trust badges.

### 2. Cognitive Ease & Calm Control
**Goal**: To minimize cognitive load, reduce decision fatigue, and provide users with a sense of calm and mastery over their interactions.
*   **HIG Alignment**: Adheres to principles of clarity and efficiency, ensuring users can understand and act quickly. Reduces unnecessary complexity.
*   **Minimalism**: Clean interfaces with ample negative space. Only essential elements are presented, guiding the user's focus.
*   **Predictable Interactions**: Consistent UI patterns and clear feedback mechanisms ensure users understand what will happen before they act.
*   **Transparent Processes**: Clear indication of progress and status, especially during multi-step processes like booking or onboarding.

### 3. Data Clarity & Trust Building
**Goal**: To present information, especially professional qualifications and performance data, in a clear, scannable, and trustworthy manner.
*   **HIG Alignment**: Emphasizes feedback and direct manipulation, ensuring data representations are accurate and responsive. Trust is built through transparent information.
*   **Visual Hierarchy**: Key data points are highlighted through size, color, and position to ensure immediate understanding.
*   **Verified Credentials**: LPGA/PGA certifications and other badges are prominently displayed as trust signals.
*   **Review Integration**: User reviews and ratings are integrated naturally into profiles, offering social proof and authenticity.

### 4. Monochrome + Single Accent Color
**Goal**: To achieve a sophisticated aesthetic using a primary neutral palette with a single, strategic accent color.
*   **HIG Alignment**: Supports clarity and depth through the judicious use of color, preventing visual clutter.
*   **Neutral Base**: A foundation of blacks, whites, and various shades of grey (ink, surface, background colors) creates a serene and elegant backdrop.
*   **Accent for Interaction**: A single, distinct accent color is reserved for primary calls-to-action, interactive elements, and key highlights, guiding user attention and establishing hierarchy.
*   **Subtle States**: Hover, active, and disabled states are communicated through subtle variations of the neutral and accent palettes.

### 5. Accessibility & Inclusivity
**Goal**: To ensure the platform is usable by all individuals, regardless of ability, adhering to WCAG AA standards.
*   **HIG Alignment**: Embeds accessibility deep into the design process, making the product inclusive by default.
*   **High Contrast**: Sufficient contrast ratios for text and interactive elements.
*   **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard navigability for all interactive components.
*   **Semantic HTML**: Proper use of semantic HTML elements to ensure screen reader compatibility and logical structure.
*   **Focus Management**: Clear visual focus indicators for interactive elements.
