# Plan 2 - Demo Profile /profile Experience

## Scope
Refine the demo profile rendered under `/profile` to showcase the intended premium experience.

## Target Files
- `web/src/app/profile/ProfileTemplate.tsx`
- `web/src/app/profile/profile-data.ts`
- `web/src/app/profile/[slug]/page.tsx`

## Deliverables
- Align sections with Calm Control spacing and typography.
- Reduce motion intensity and provide reduced-motion fallbacks.
- Ensure trust signals and CTA placement match VIP persona needs.
- Keep the demo experience consistent with the production templates.

## Progress
- [x] Hero CTA added with above-the-fold trust chips.
- [x] Section heading sizes and spacing tuned to Calm Control scale.
- [x] Reduced-motion fallbacks added for animations and hover scaling.
- [x] Final CTA spacing and typography reduced to match production tone.

## Success Criteria
- Demo page visually aligns with design tokens and spacing rules.
- Motion does not hinder readability on mobile.
- CTA is visible within the first screen on mobile and desktop.

## Notes
Use this plan for marketing/demo polish; avoid diverging from production UX patterns.
