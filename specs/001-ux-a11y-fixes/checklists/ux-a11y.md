# UX/Accessibility Sanity Check - 001-ux-a11y-fixes

## Purpose
This checklist serves as a high-level sanity check for key UX friction points and accessibility fixes for existing UI components, ensuring major issues are addressed by both developers and QA/designers.

## Requirement Completeness
- [ ] CHK001 - Are the requirements for scroll-detection based show/hide + minimize option for Mobile Floating CTA clearly defined? [Completeness, Spec §Mobile CTA]
- [ ] CHK002 - Are the requirements for custom `useFocusTrap` hook, including behavior for Tab and Escape keys, fully documented? [Completeness, Spec §Focus Trap]
- [ ] CHK003 - Are the requirements for separating external brand colors in `global.css` specified? [Completeness, Spec §Design Tokens]
- [ ] CHK004 - Are the requirements for standard ARIA attributes and `aria-live` regions for screen reader compatibility fully articulated? [Completeness, Spec §Screen Reader]
- [ ] CHK005 - Are the requirements for horizontal scroll + scroll hint UI for responsive tables defined? [Completeness, Spec §Tables Responsive]

## Requirement Clarity
- [ ] CHK006 - Is the timing (e.g., "1 second") for Mobile Floating CTA reappearance after scroll stop explicitly quantified? [Clarity, Spec §Mobile CTA]
- [ ] CHK007 - Is the visual indication for keyboard focus (e.g., "파란색 링") described with sufficient detail for consistency? [Clarity, Spec §Keyboard Access]
- [ ] CHK008 - Are specific examples or guidelines provided for `aria-label` usage on icon-only buttons? [Clarity, Spec §Screen Reader]
- [ ] CHK009 - Is the visual cue for table scroll hints (e.g., "그라데이션 또는 화살표") clearly specified? [Clarity, Spec §Tables Responsive]

## Requirement Consistency
- [ ] CHK010 - Is the behavior of floating CTA consistent across all relevant mobile pages? [Consistency, Spec §Mobile CTA]
- [ ] CHK011 - Is the `useFocusTrap` implementation consistent for all modal-like components across the application? [Consistency, Spec §Focus Trap]
- [ ] CHK012 - Are branding color variables used consistently, avoiding hardcoded values, across all components integrating external brands? [Consistency, Spec §Design Tokens]

## Scenario Coverage
- [ ] CHK013 - Are requirements defined for the interaction of Mobile Floating CTA with various content types or lengths? [Coverage, Spec §Mobile CTA]
- [ ] CHK014 - Are requirements specified for focus management when a modal is closed, returning focus to the trigger element? [Coverage, Spec §Focus Trap]
- [ ] CHK015 - Are requirements for screen reader announcements defined for all dynamic content updates (e.g., form submissions, search results)? [Coverage, Spec §Screen Reader]
- [ ] CHK016 - Are scenarios for tables with very few columns (where horizontal scroll might be unnecessary) addressed? [Coverage, Spec §Tables Responsive]

## Edge Case Coverage
- [ ] CHK017 - Is the fallback behavior for `useFocusTrap` defined if no focusable elements are found within a trapped container? [Edge Case, Spec §Focus Trap]
- [ ] CHK018 - Are requirements specified for handling very long text within ARIA labels or live regions without excessive verbosity? [Edge Case, Spec §Screen Reader]

## Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] CHK019 - Are the performance implications (e.g., scroll jank) of the Mobile Floating CTA's scroll-detection mechanism considered and mitigated in requirements? [NFR, Spec §Mobile CTA]
- [ ] CHK020 - Are the integration requirements for `axe-core` in Playwright E2E tests, including reporting thresholds, clearly documented? [NFR, Spec §Accessibility Testing]
