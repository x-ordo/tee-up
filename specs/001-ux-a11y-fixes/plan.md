# Implementation Plan: UX Accessibility & Design Consistency Fixes

**Branch**: `001-ux-a11y-fixes` | **Date**: 2025-12-05 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-ux-a11y-fixes/spec.md`

## Summary

This plan outlines the implementation for improving UX accessibility and design consistency, focusing on P0/P1 issues. The core requirements include fixing mobile CTA content obstruction, ensuring full keyboard accessibility with focus traps, enforcing design token usage over hardcoded values, and enhancing screen reader compatibility.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js 14.x, React 18, Tailwind CSS 3.x, Express.js 4.x
**Storage**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) - No changes to data model.
**Testing**: Playwright, Jest, axe-core
**Target Platform**: Web Browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge - latest 2 versions)
**Project Type**: Web application (monorepo with frontend and backend)
**Performance Goals**: Adherence to WCAG 2.1 AA standards. Maintain or improve existing page load performance.
**Constraints**: Minimize introduction of new external dependencies. All fixes should be consistent with the existing "Korean Luxury Minimalism" design system.
**Scale/Scope**: The scope is limited to fixing UX and accessibility issues in existing UI components as outlined in the feature specification.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Result**: SKIPPED. The project constitution file at `.specify/memory/constitution.md` is a generic template with no project-specific rules defined. A constitution check cannot be performed.

```

**Structure Decision**: The project follows a monorepo structure with separate `web` (frontend) and `api` (backend) directories. This feature's changes are primarily concentrated in the `web` directory, involving the creation of a new custom hook (`useFocusTrap`), new E2E tests, and modifications to existing UI components and styles.
